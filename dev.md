## Version
- 1.x

## Technology involved"
- GitHub Pages
	- REPO - [jarrodrose/Board-Games](https://github.com/jarrodrose/Board-Games)
	- Built from 'main' branch
- Jekyll
- Minima 3.0 Theme
	- explicitly using 3.0 as GitHub Pages default is minima 2.x
- Custom layouts and includes built on top of the Minima base

## Notes
- Keep an eye on when Minima 3.x becomes the default
- Might need a rebuild.
	- I think I might have over-engineered it, and
	- built too quickly without a clear data structure or plan
- Version two should take learnings from version one.
