overview: "Mahjong is a classic four-player tile game of Chinese origin, dating back to the mid-19th century. It is a game of skill, strategy, calculation, and a bit of luck – often likened to the card game rummy for its meld-making gameplay:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}. Players draw and discard decorative tiles (bearing Chinese characters and symbols) with the goal of assembling a winning hand of sets and pairs. A standard Mahjong set contains 144 tiles, divided into suits (dots, bamboo, characters) and honor tiles (winds and dragons), along with optional bonus tiles:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. The game’s appeal lies in its blend of tactical decision-making, memory, and social interaction, as well as its rich tradition. Originating in China, Mahjong spread worldwide in the early 20th century and remains hugely popular across East Asia and beyond."

      - "144 engraved tiles – standard Chinese sets include 144 thick tiles made of wood, bone, or plastic, marked with Chinese symbols. These comprise 108 suit tiles (36 Circles/Dots, 36 Bamboos, 36 Characters – numbered 1 through 9, four of each number):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}, 16 Wind tiles (4 each of East, South, West, North), 12 Dragon tiles (4 each of Red, Green, White):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}, and 8 optional bonus tiles (4 Flowers and 4 Seasons):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}."
      - "Regional tile variations – Some versions use different tile counts or special tiles. For example, Japanese Riichi Mahjong uses 136 tiles (omitting Flowers/Seasons), while American Mah Jongg sets use 152 tiles (adding 8 Joker tiles and using only 4 Flowers). Many modern sets also include a few blank spare tiles for replacements."
      - "Dice – Typically 2 (sometimes 3) six-sided dice are included, used to determine the dealer and where to break the wall during setup:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}."
      - "Dealer/Wind marker – A marker or a set of wind-indicator discs to show the current dealer (East) and the prevailing wind of the round."
      - "Scoring sticks or chips – Traditional sets often come with scoring sticks (mini sticks of varying denominations) or counters to keep track of points/wins for gambling or scoring purposes."
      - "Tile racks & pushers – Some sets (especially American Mahjong) include 4 racks to hold each player’s tiles and pushers (arms) to help build or push out the tile wall."
      - "Rulebook and reference cards – A rulebook or quick reference card is usually provided, particularly in American Mahjong sets (which use a yearly hand-scoring card) or other commercial variants, to outline the specific rules and scoring system."
setup:
  - "Assign seating and wind positions: Randomly determine each player’s seat and corresponding wind (East, South, West, North). Often this is done by shuffling the four wind tiles face-down and having players draw one, or by dice roll. The player who becomes East is the starting dealer."
  - "Shuffle (\"wash\") the tiles: All 144 tiles are placed face-down on the table and thoroughly mixed in a chaotic shuffle by all players. This ensures a random distribution."
  - "Build the walls: After shuffling, each player gathers 36 random tiles and stacks them into a two-tier wall (18 stacks of 2 tiles) in front of themselves. The four walls are then pushed together to form a rough square \"wall\" enclosing the center of the table."
  - "Break the wall and deal: The dealer (East) rolls the dice to decide where to break the wall. Counting along the wall, a section is split, creating an opening. Starting from that break, tiles are dealt in rounds of two stacks to each player. Traditionally, each player ends up with 13 tiles, and the dealer takes one extra (14th) tile to begin."
  - "Prepare for play: If any player received bonus flower or season tiles in their initial 13, they immediately reveal those and draw replacement tiles from the end of the wall (often from the section called the \"dead wall\"). These bonus tiles are set aside, and can provide bonus points but are not used in a player’s hand. Once replacements (if any) are drawn, the dealer begins the game."
  - "Game start: The dealer discards one tile from their hand to the center, announcing it. This starts the cycle of play with the next player (to the dealer’s right) ready to take their turn."
gameplay:
  - name: "Turn Sequence"
    steps:
      - "**Draw or Claim**: On a player’s turn, they normally draw the next tile from the wall into their hand. Alternatively, if the previous player just discarded a tile that someone can use to complete a set or a winning hand, an eligible player may claim that discard **out of turn**. Claiming a discard interrupts the normal turn order – the claimer takes the tile to form a meld or win, and the game resumes from them."
      - "**Meld (Pung/Chow/Kong)**: If a player can form a meld (set) in their hand, they may declare it. Common melds are Pung (three identical tiles), Chow (three consecutive numbers in the same suit), or Kong (four identical tiles). Declaring a meld using another player’s discard requires immediately exposing that set on the table. (Chows can only be claimed from the discard of the player immediately before you in turn order, whereas Pungs/Kongs and winning calls have priority over Chows.)"
      - "**Discard**: After drawing a tile (or completing any meld declarations), the player must discard one tile from their hand to return to the hand size of 13. The discard is placed face-up in the center. They should call out the tile’s name (especially in formal play) as they discard. This ends the turn. Discarded tiles remain on the table and cannot be taken later (only immediately when discarded)."
      - "**Call and Interruptions**: When a tile is discarded, any other player may call it **before** the next player draws, if it completes something for them. To claim a discard for a meld, the player calls out the meld name (\"Pung!\" or \"Chow!\", etc.) and shows the meld. To claim it for a win, they call \"Mahjong!\" (or the local equivalent) and reveal their whole hand. If multiple players want the same discard, a win claim has highest priority, then a Pung/Kong, and last a Chow. The turn order then skips to the player who made the claim (if it wasn’t the next in sequence)."
      - "Play then continues with the next player in counter-clockwise order drawing (unless the turn was taken by someone claiming a discard). This cycle of draw/claim and discard repeats until a hand is won or the tiles are exhausted."
  - name: "Hand End and Scoring"
    steps:
      - "**Mahjong (Winning a Hand)**: A hand ends when a player completes a legal 14-tile hand and declares victory (calling out “Mahjong!” or an equivalent term and revealing their winning set of tiles). A standard winning hand consists of four melds (sets of 3 or 4 tiles) plus one pair (called the \"eyes\"). There are also special hands in various rulesets that don’t follow the 4-set-1-pair structure. If a player wins by claiming someone’s discard, that discard completes their hand; if they draw the winning tile themselves from the wall, it’s called a \"self-draw\" win. The winning hand is validated and then scored according to the variant’s scoring rules."
      - "**Scoring**: The winner’s hand is scored based on the melds and patterns it contains, often earning points (or \"fan\") for rarer combinations. Other players may score minor points for certain exposed sets or drawn flowers, etc., depending on the rules. In many versions (like Hong Kong style), only the winner scores points from others; in others (like some Chinese or Japanese rules), all players’ hands can score points but the winner typically scores more. Payment of points usually involves transferring scoring sticks or chips from the losing players to the winner according to the final score."
      - "**Draw/Stalemate**: If all tiles from the wall are used (or a specific limit is reached) and no one has won, the hand is a draw (called a \"goulash hand\" or simply a draw). In a draw, typically no points are exchanged (though some variants have provisions for a draw, such as all players paying a small fee to dealer, etc.). A new hand then begins with the same dealer (East remains dealer if no one won)."
      - "**Continuing Play**: After each hand, seats/winds may rotate depending on the rules. Commonly, if the dealer (East) wins or the hand is a draw, the dealer retains their position (\"stays East\") for the next hand; if another player won, the deal passes to the next player (previous South becomes the new East, etc.). The game then continues with the next hand from the dealing stage. A match of Mahjong is often structured as rounds named after wind directions (East Round, South Round, etc.). A full game might consist of one round (all players have been East once) or up to four rounds (East, South, West, North) for a complete cycle, depending on house rules or agreed length."
      - "**Winning the Game**: After the predetermined number of rounds or hands, or when players decide to stop, final scores are compared. The player with the highest total score (sum of all hand results) is the overall winner of the session. In many social games, Mahjong is played for small stakes or bragging rights, and the scoring adds a gambling element to the game’s conclusion."
highlights:
  - "**Rich Tradition**: Mahjong carries over a century of history and cultural significance. The game originated in Qing-era China and has been passed down through generations. It’s often associated with family gatherings and festivals, and over time has accrued numerous customs, superstitions, and even its own lore – making it more than just a game in many cultures."
  - "**Skill and Strategy**: The game blends luck with deep strategy. Success requires sharp observation, memory (keeping track of discards and possibilities), and tactical decision-making – such as when to commit to a certain hand, which tiles to discard to avoid helping opponents, and how to adapt to changing circumstances. Experienced players learn to assess probabilities and read opponents’ intentions from their discards, adding a chess-like layer of strategy."
  - "**Social Gameplay**: Mahjong is traditionally a very social affair. Four players sit around a table, and the rituals of shuffling tiles, building the wall, and exchanging banter are integral to the experience. It’s commonly played in friendly home games, on street corners in Asia:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}, or in organized clubs and tournaments. The game encourages interaction, whether through lively conversation or competitive tension, and often involves light gambling or scoring which heightens the excitement."
  - "**Replayability and Depth**: No two Mahjong games are the same due to the huge number of tile shuffles and possible hand combinations. The game’s mix of random draws and player choices means there’s always an element of unpredictability. Yet, the depth of the meld-building and scoring systems (which can be simple or highly complex in different versions) provides endless replay value – players can always improve their skill and try new strategies or rule variants."
  - "**Global Variations**: One of Mahjong’s strengths is its adaptability – over the years, many regional versions have developed. From the fast-paced, reward-rich Japanese Riichi Mahjong to the pattern-based American Mah Jongg with its yearly changing hands, there’s a variant for every taste. This diversity means enthusiasts can enjoy different styles of play, all while recognizing the same core game at heart."
versions:
  - name: "Chinese Classical Mahjong"
    description: "The original traditional form of the game as played in late 19th to early 20th century China. Uses the standard 144 tiles (including flowers/seasons) and relatively simple scoring. Hands are scored based on basic sets and a few special hands. This version (also called Old Mahjong) was the basis for many later variants."
  - name: "Hong Kong/Cantonese Mahjong"
    description: "A widely played variant that evolved from the Chinese classical game, popular in Hong Kong and Guangdong (Canton) region. It typically uses 136 tiles (flowers optional) and a straightforward scoring system based on \"fan\" (doubling points for certain melds or conditions). Hong Kong style is known for its simplicity and is often used as an introductory ruleset:contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}. Many overseas Chinese communities play a similar style sometimes called Cantonese or Singapore Mahjong (with slight local scoring tweaks)."
  - name: "Japanese Mahjong (Riichi)"
    description: "The Japanese version (also called Riichi Mahjong) is a highly strategic and ritualized variant. It uses 136 tiles (no flowers, but includes red fives as dora indicators in many sets) and features the unique Riichi rule (a declaration of a ready hand for a potential scoring bonus) and Dora bonus tiles that add extra points. Japanese Mahjong has a rich scoring system with many yaku (hand patterns) needed to win, a furiten rule (discouraging certain discards), and only the winner scores (as a payment from others). It’s the style played in Japanese Mahjong parlors, the basis for many video game versions, and is governed by organizations that hold professional tournaments."
  - name: "American Mah Jongg (NMJL rules)"
    description: "The American version of Mahjong is markedly different, having been standardized by the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937. It uses 152 tiles: the standard set plus 8 Joker tiles (wild cards), and only 4 flowers. A defining feature is the Charleston – a sequence of mandatory tile passes between players at the start of each hand to exchange tiles. Instead of melds scoring points, players try to assemble specific hand patterns that are listed on an official yearly card published by the NMJL (the card changes annually, introducing new hand combinations and point values). American Mah Jongg has a distinct following, often played in community centers and social groups in the US."
  - name: "Mahjong Competition Rules (MCR)"
    description: "Also known as Chinese Official Mahjong, this is a modern standardized ruleset created for international competition (first popularized in China in 1998). MCR combines elements from various Chinese variants and has an extensive catalog of scoring patterns with each hand earning a certain point value. It uses 144 tiles (with flowers) and has fixed minimum points needed to win a hand (usually 8 points minimum). MCR is the ruleset used in official tournaments held by organizations like the World Mahjong Organization and European Mahjong Association, to allow players from different regions to compete under unified rules."
