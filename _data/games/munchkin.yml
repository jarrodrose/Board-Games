overview: "Munchkin is a comedic card game that parodies traditional role-playing adventures by focusing on monster slaying, treasure grabbing, and (often) shameless backstabbing. Players race to be the first to reach Level 10, using gear, special abilities, and cunning to outsmart both monsters and fellow players. Its humorous artwork, pun-filled cards, and simple rules make Munchkin a popular choice for lighthearted, fast-paced tabletop fun."
components:
  - "Door deck (various monster, curse, and class/race cards)"
  - "Treasure deck (equipment, items, and special effect cards)"
  - "Level tracking method (often players use the included side card or any chosen system)"
  - "Rulebook"
setup:
  - "Separate the cards into two decks: Doors and Treasures. Shuffle each deck thoroughly."
  - "Deal each player 2 Door cards and 2 Treasure cards."
  - "Each player starts at Level 1."
  - "You're ready to begin—pick a player to go first (house rule suggestion: whoever can make the best \"Munchkin\" face!)."
gameplay:
  - "Kick Open the Door: Draw the top card from the Door deck. If it's a monster, fight it. If it's a curse, apply its effect. Otherwise, keep the card."
  - "Look for Trouble / Loot the Room: If you didn't fight a monster, you may either play a monster from your hand to battle it or draw a face-down Door card to add to your hand."
  - "Charity: If you have more than 5 cards at the end of your turn, give the excess to the player with the lowest level (or discard if you are the lowest)."
  - "Fighting Monsters: Compare your total combat strength (level + bonuses) with the monster's. Other players can help—or hinder—by playing cards. If you beat the monster, you go up a level and collect Treasure cards. If you lose, you suffer the monster's \"Bad Stuff\" effect."
  - "Winning: The first player to reach Level 10 (by defeating a monster) wins!"
highlights:
  - "Lighthearted humor and whimsical artwork make it accessible to nearly any group."
  - "Quick setup and rules let you jump into the action without a lengthy tutorial."
  - "High interactivity—you can help or backstab other players, creating lively table banter."
  - "Ideal for anyone who likes a blend of luck, mild strategy, and comedic chaos."
