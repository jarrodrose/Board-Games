overview: "Disney Villainous lets 2–6 players step into the shoes of iconic Disney villains, each pursuing a unique, movie-inspired objective while thwarting opponents with \"Fate\" cards drawn from their own films. Every villain has a personal board (Realm), custom villain deck, and matching Fate deck. On your turn you move your villain mover to a location, perform the available actions, and play cards that advance your scheme or hinder your rivals. The asymmetry—every villain wins in a different way—makes each play feel fresh, and expansions add new baddies who seamlessly mix with the originals."
