overview: "Thud (sometimes stylized as Thud!) is an abstract strategy board game for two players that originated from Terry Pratchett’s Discworld universe:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. Designed by Trevor Truran in 2002 (with Pratchett contributing the name and lore):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}, the game simulates a battle between a squad of Dwarfs and a group of Trolls – inspired by the fictional Battle of Koom Valley in the Discworld novels (as depicted in Pratchett’s 34th novel, *Thud!*). One player commands 32 dwarf pieces while the other controls 8 trolls on an octagon-shaped board (a 15×15 grid with the corners removed):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. The two sides have very different movement and capture abilities, similar in spirit to the Norse tafl games like *Hnefatafl*:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}. Because of this asymmetry, a full match of Thud consists of two rounds with players swapping sides; the overall winner is determined by combining scores from both rounds:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}."
components:
  - name: "Game Components"
    sub:
      - "1 game board (15×15 grid with triangular corners removed, creating an octagonal playing area):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}"
      - "32 dwarf pieces (often depicted as small carved figurines):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}"
      - "8 troll pieces (larger figurines):contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}"
      - "1 Thud stone (a special marker placed at the center of the board):contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}"
      - "1 rulebook (including both the classic rules and the 'Koom Valley Thud' variant rules):contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}"
      - "1 lore booklet titled *“Thud – A Historical Perspective”* written by Terry Pratchett (providing in-universe background):contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}"
setup:
  - "Lay out the Thud board and place the Thud stone on the central square:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}."
  - "Place the 8 Troll pieces on the eight squares immediately surrounding the Thud stone in the center of the board:contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}."
  - "Place the 32 Dwarf pieces on all the perimeter squares of the board, **except** leave the four corner-aligned edge squares (those directly horizontal or vertical from the Thud stone) empty:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}."
  - "Decide who will play as the Dwarf side first – the dwarf player will take the first move of the game:contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}. (Players will switch roles to Trolls/Dwarfs in the second round of a full match.)"
  - "All pieces start on the board in this initial arrangement. Begin play with the dwarf side moving first."
gameplay:
  - name: "On each turn"
    steps:
      - "Move a piece: On a player’s turn, they move one of their pieces (Dwarf or Troll). Dwarfs can move any number of squares in a straight line (orthogonally or diagonally) – similar to a chess queen – but cannot jump over any pieces:contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}. Trolls can move only a single square in any direction (like a king) and may not move into an occupied square:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}."
      - "Special moves (optional): Instead of a standard move, players may perform a special move unique to their side that can capture opposing pieces. **Dwarf Hurl** – if a group of dwarfs is lined up with no gaps between them, the dwarf at the rear of the line can ‘hurl’ the dwarf at the front forward in the same line direction:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}. The hurled dwarf can move a number of squares up to the number of dwarfs in that line, and is allowed to land on a square occupied by a Troll, capturing it (the troll is removed and the dwarf takes that square):contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}. **Troll Shove** – if two or more trolls are adjacent in a straight line, a troll at one end of the line can be pushed forward in that line up to a number of squares equal to the number of trolls in the group:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. A shoved troll cannot land on another piece, but if its move places it adjacent to any dwarf pieces, all those adjacent dwarf pieces are immediately captured (removed):contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. *Note:* A troll shove is only legal if it will capture at least one dwarf:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}."
      - "Capturing rules: Besides the special hurl/shove moves described, captures can also occur as a result of normal movement. If a Dwarf moves (or is hurled) onto a square occupied by a Troll, that Troll is captured and removed:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. If a Troll moves (or is shoved) and ends its move on a square adjacent to one or more Dwarfs, the Troll may immediately capture **one** of those adjacent Dwarfs (at the Troll player’s discretion) and remove it from the board:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}. In the case of a shove move, **all** dwarf pieces adjacent to the troll’s final position are captured simultaneously:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}. Captures happen immediately upon the move that causes them."
      - "Turn sequence: Play alternates between the Dwarf player and Troll player. The Dwarf side always takes the first turn of a new game:contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}. On each turn, only one piece may be moved (using either a normal move or special move) by the active player. After resolving any captures from that move, the turn ends."
  - name: "Game End & Scoring"
    steps:
      - "A round (battle) of Thud ends by mutual agreement when both players concur that no further captures are possible (i.e. the situation is a stalemate), **or** when one player has no legal moves remaining:contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}. At that point, the players tally the score for that battle."
      - "Scoring: The Dwarf player earns 1 point for each dwarf piece still on the board, and the Troll player earns 4 points for each surviving troll piece:contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}. (Trolls are valued higher because they are fewer in number.) The difference in these scores can be noted as the result of that round."
      - "To ensure fairness (due to the asymmetrical sides), a full match of Thud consists of two rounds. After the first round, the players **swap sides** and set up the board again for a second game with the same initial layout (the player who was controlling dwarfs now controls trolls and vice versa):contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}. Play the second round to its conclusion and score it in the same way."
      - "Final victory: After two rounds, each player will have a total score (points as Dwarfs + points as Trolls from the two games). The player with the higher combined total is the overall winner of the match:contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30}. (If the totals tie, the match is a draw.)"
highlights:
  - "**Asymmetrical Strategy:** Thud offers a unique asymmetrical gameplay experience. One side commands a large force of 32 quick but fragile Dwarfs, while the other side leads 8 slow but powerful Trolls – each side has distinct movement and capture abilities:contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}. This imbalance creates a deep strategic challenge, as playing Dwarfs feels very different from playing Trolls."
  - "**Discworld Theme & Lore:** The game is steeped in Terry Pratchett’s Discworld lore, though it stands on its own as an abstract game. It re-imagines the legendary (fictional) clash between trolls and dwarfs in Koom Valley as a tactical board game:contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}. Official sets even include a pamphlet titled *“Thud – A Historical Perspective”* written in-universe by Pratchett, adding flavor and backstory to the experience:contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}."
  - "**Easy to Learn, Hard to Master:** The core rules are relatively straightforward – on each turn you move a piece and possibly capture – and can be learned in a few minutes:contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}. However, mastering the game is challenging. Success requires planning formations (for dwarfs) or positioning for shoves (for trolls), and anticipating your opponent’s moves. The asymmetry means players must develop two different sets of skills (one for each side) to truly excel."
  - "**Strategic Depth and Tactics:** Thud emphasizes strategy over luck – there are no dice or card draws. Dwarf players must often coordinate and sacrifice a few pieces to slow down advancing trolls:contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}, forming defensive “huddles” and setting up hurls at the right moments. Troll players, in turn, need to avoid being isolated and try to corral the dwarfs, using shoves and careful positioning (keeping trolls spread out to cover more ground:contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36}). The two-round format (swapping sides) also adds strategic depth, as a player must perform well as both dwarfs and trolls."
  - "**Quality Components:** The production quality of the game is notable. The pieces in official editions are detailed resin miniatures inspired by the famous Lewis chessmen, giving the game a thematic, rustic charm:contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}. The board in the “travel edition” is a durable cloth canvas (around 47 cm square) that can be folded, and the game often comes with a drawstring bag for portability:contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}. The attractive components and artwork make the battle of Thud visually appealing on the table."

      description: "An alternate scenario introduced with the second edition of the game (released alongside Pratchett’s *Thud!* novel). This variant provides a faster-paced, objective-driven game using the same board and pieces. The key addition is a movable “Rock” (the Thud stone) which the Dwarf side must escort to a specific area of the board, while the Troll side tries to capture it:contentReference[oaicite:39]{index=39}. Rules changes in Koom Valley Thud include expanded movement for Trolls (up to 3 squares per move) and completely different capture mechanics (e.g. trolls capture by ‘trampling’ over dwarfs, and dwarfs capture by trapping trolls between two dwarf pieces):contentReference[oaicite:40]{index=40}:contentReference[oaicite:41]{index=41}. This variant offers a fresh challenge and was packaged with the later editions of the game."
