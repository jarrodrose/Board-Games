overview: "Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot is a humorous, fast-paced card game where players collect carrots in hopes of holding the Magic Carrot at the end of the game. Players must protect their own bunnies while using outrageous weapons, tricks, and resource management to eliminate opponents’ rabbits and acquire more carrot cards. The winner is determined not by points but by luck: once all carrots are collected, the Magic Carrot is revealed, and the player holding it wins. This mix of strategy, unpredictability, and comedy has made Killer Bunnies a cult favorite among casual and hobby gamers alike."
