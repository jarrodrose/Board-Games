# Munchkin

## Summary
Munchkin is a comedic card game that parodies classic role-playing adventures, tasking players with racing to reach Level 10 by defeating monsters, looting treasures, and (often) undermining their friends. Each turn involves “kicking down the door,” revealing challenges or beneficial cards, and navigating battles that can be influenced by anyone at the table. With its pun-laden card titles, cartoonish illustrations by John Kovalic, and tongue-in-cheek humor, Munchkin offers a lighthearted take on dungeon-crawling tropes.

In Munchkin, players build their characters by acquiring Classes, Races, and equipment that modify combat strength and abilities. A significant part of the fun arises from the constant potential for backstabbing: opponents can help or hinder each other in fights, playing curses or buffs that swing combat outcomes in surprising ways. This chaotic interplay keeps games fresh and unpredictable.

Renowned for its straightforward rules and playful spirit, Munchkin is easy for newcomers to pick up yet still captivates experienced players. Its success has led to numerous expansions and spin-off sets, all of which can be mixed or combined to create whimsical—and often hilariously unbalanced—mash-ups.
