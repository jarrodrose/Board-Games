# Mysterium

## Summary

Mysterium is a cooperative board game where players immerse themselves in a supernatural murder mystery. Set in a haunted mansion, one player assumes the role of a silent ghost, while the others become psychic mediums striving to uncover the truth behind the ghost's untimely demise. Through a series of abstract and evocative vision cards, the ghost provides clues to guide the mediums in identifying the correct suspect, location, and weapon involved in the murder.

The game unfolds over seven rounds, during which the ghost presents vision cards to each medium. These cards, rich in surreal imagery, serve as the ghost's sole means of communication. Mediums must interpret these visions, discuss their insights, and collaborate to deduce their individual sets of suspect, location, and weapon. The challenge lies in the abstract nature of the visions, requiring players to rely on their intuition and collective reasoning to piece together the mystery.

If all mediums successfully identify their respective sets before time runs out, they proceed to a final round. Here, the ghost provides a limited number of visions to hint at the true culprit among the identified suspects. The mediums then vote on who they believe is the actual murderer. A correct majority vote ensures victory, allowing the ghost to rest in peace. Mysterium's unique blend of cooperative gameplay, imaginative storytelling, and stunning artwork offers an engaging experience that challenges players' deductive skills and fosters teamwork.
