# Mysterium

## Summary
Mysterium is a cooperative deduction board game in which players work together to solve a supernatural mystery. Set in the 1920s, one player assumes the role of a silent Ghost attempting to communicate via dreamlike 'vision' cards, while the other players are psychic mediums striving to interpret these cryptic images. By deducing the correct suspect, location, and murder weapon, everyone hopes to piece together the narrative of the Ghost’s untimely demise.

Gameplay unfolds over a series of rounds where the Ghost provides visions in the form of beautifully illustrated cards, challenging mediums to connect abstract images with the murder’s key elements. As the mediums progress, they narrow down the possible culprits, places, and objects before the final round—where a single correct combination must be agreed upon for the group to collectively win. The tension created by the time limit and the ambiguity of the artwork fosters lively discussions and creative theorizing.

Praised for its atmospheric art, unique communication mechanic, and immersive theme, Mysterium accommodates both strategic and casual players. Its cooperative nature encourages teamwork and open conversation, making it a favorite for larger groups looking for a thematic puzzle-solving experience.
