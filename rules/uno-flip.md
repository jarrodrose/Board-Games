## Summary
UNO FLIP plays like regular UNO, except there are two sides to the deck of cards: a “Mild” side and a “Wild” side. You start playing with the “Mild Side,” but whenever someone plays a FLIP card, everything gets flipped over (the deck, the discard pile, and even the cards in your hand!) and now everyone must play off the “Wild Side” of the cards. The Wild Side has different Action Cards with much stiffer penalties. Player’s must play with the Wild Side cards until someone plays another FLIP card, and then play goes back to the Mild Side, and so on until someone has played all the cards in their hand, ending the round.

## Setup
- Since the deck is two-sided, make sure all the cards of each side are facing the same way: all the Mild Side cards facing one way, all the Wild Side cards facing the other way.
- Choose a Dealer and then Shuffle the cards.
- Deal 7 cards to each player. Hold the cards with the Mild Side facing you and the Wild Side facing your opponents.
- Place the remainder of the deck with the Mild Side facedown to form a DRAW pile (the Wild Side cards will be facing UP).
- The top card of the DRAW pile is turned over to begin a DISCARD pile (with the Mild Side cards facing UP). If this card is an Action Card, ignore it and flip over the next card.
- The player to the left of the dealer goes first and play proceeds clockwise.

## Play
On your turn, you try to get rid of all your cards by playing ONE CARD onto the Discard Pile.

### If you HAVE a matching card in your hand, you may PLAY IT on the Discard Pile.
1. You can only play a card if it matches at least one attribute of the top card on the Discard Pile: its color, number, or symbol.
2. If the card you played is an Action Card, it does something special!

### If you DO NOT HAVE a matching card, DRAW ONE CARD from the Draw Pile.
1. If your new card can be played (see above), then you may play it now. If not, your turn is over.
2. You may choose to draw a card instead of playing one, even if you have a playable card in your hand.

## Going Out
Whether you are playing with the Mild Side or the Wild Side, when you play your next-to-last card, you must yell “UNO” (meaning “one”) to indicate that you have only one card left. If you don’t yell “UNO” and you are caught before the next player begins their turn, you must draw two cards.

## Winning
When a player plays their final card, they win. Time to shuffle the cards and play again!
