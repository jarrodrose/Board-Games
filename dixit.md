# Dixit

## Summary

Dixit is an enchanting storytelling card game that encourages players to let their imaginations run wild. Designed by Jean-Louis Roubira and illustrated by Marie Cardouat, it was first published in 2008 by Libellud. The game features 84 beautifully illustrated, text-free cards, each depicting dreamlike scenes open to various interpretations.

In Dixit, players take turns as the "storyteller," selecting a card from their hand and providing a clue—a word, phrase, or sentence—that relates to the image without revealing it. The other players then choose a card from their own hands that best matches the storyteller's clue. All chosen cards are shuffled and revealed, and players vote on which image they believe is the storyteller's. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guesses and the ability of the storyteller to craft a clue that is neither too obvious nor too obscure.

Dixit's unique blend of creativity, abstract thinking, and social interaction has earned it numerous accolades, including the prestigious Spiel des Jahres award in 2010. Its simple rules and engaging gameplay make it accessible to a wide audience, fostering imagination and storytelling skills among players.
