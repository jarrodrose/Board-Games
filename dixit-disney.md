# Dixit: Disney Edition

## Summary

Dixit: Disney Edition is a standalone version of the acclaimed storytelling game Dixit, blending the imaginative gameplay of the original with the enchanting worlds of Disney and Pixar. Players are invited to craft clues inspired by 84 beautifully illustrated cards, each depicting scenes from classic and contemporary Disney and Pixar films, ranging from "Snow White" to "Turning Red."

In this edition, players take turns as the storyteller, selecting a card from their hand and providing a clue—a word, phrase, or sentence—that relates to the image without revealing it. The other players then choose a card from their own hands that best matches the storyteller's clue. All chosen cards are shuffled and revealed, and players vote on which image they believe is the storyteller's. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the guesses and the ability of the storyteller to craft a clue that is neither too obvious nor too obscure.

Dixit: Disney Edition maintains the classic rules that have made Dixit a beloved game worldwide, while infusing the magic of Disney to captivate both new and seasoned players. The game encourages creativity, abstract thinking, and social interaction, making it a delightful addition to family game nights and gatherings with friends.
