# Dixit: Disney Edition
![Placeholder Image](./placeholder.jpg)

## Overview
Dixit: Disney Edition is a standalone version of the popular storytelling card game, blending the imaginative gameplay of Dixit with the beloved characters and scenes from almost a century of Disney and Pixar films. As in the original Dixit, each round has an “active player” who provides a short clue or prompt inspired by one of their cards. Other players submit a card from their own hands that could match the clue. All submitted cards are revealed, and everyone (except the active player) tries to guess which image belongs to the clue-giver.

Thanks to Disney-inspired illustrations, the game resonates strongly with fans of Disney and Pixar. Players may use lyrics, quotes, or references from their favorite animated classics, adding a whimsical, nostalgic twist to the familiar Dixit formula.

## Components (What's in the Box)
- A deck of large-format Dixit: Disney Edition cards, each depicting scenes or characters from Disney/Pixar movies
- Scoring board or track (depending on the edition)
- Scoring tokens (rabbit or other markers for each player)
- Voting tokens for each player
- Rulebook

## Setup
1. Lay out the scoreboard within reach of all players.
2. Each player selects a scoring token and places it at the start of the scoring track.
3. Shuffle the Disney-themed Dixit cards thoroughly and deal 6 cards to each player.
4. Hand out voting tokens to each player. The specific numbers on these tokens will vary based on player count.
5. Choose the first active player by any preferred method.

## How to Play
1. The active player selects one card from their hand and gives a short clue or prompt (word, phrase, or reference) that captures its essence without being too obvious or too vague.
2. The other players each choose one card from their hand that they feel fits the prompt, then pass it face down to the active player.
3. The active player shuffles all the submitted cards, then places them face up in a row for everyone to see.
4. All players except the active player secretly vote (using their numbered tokens) on which card they believe is the active player's.
5. Reveal votes and score:
   - If everyone or no one guesses the active player's card, the active player scores 0, while each of the other players gains 2 points.
   - Otherwise, the active player and each correct guesser score 3 points.
   - Any player whose submitted card received votes also gains 1 point per vote.
6. Each player draws cards to return their hand to 6. Move the active player role clockwise and repeat until one player reaches the end of the scoring track (or until you decide to stop).
