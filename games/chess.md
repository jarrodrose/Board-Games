overview: 'Chess is a two‑player strategy game with origins dating back over a millennium. Played on an 8 × 8 checkered board, each side commands 16 pieces with distinct movement patterns, seeking to force the opposing king into checkmate, a position where capture is unavoidable. Modern rules—codified by the International Chess Federation (FIDE)—emerged in the 15th century and remain largely unchanged today. Chess is celebrated for its deep tactics, vast opening theory, and rich history of competitive play, from local clubs to world championship matches.'

## Components (What’s in the Box)

* 1 folding or roll‑up board (8 ranks × 8 files, alternating light/dark squares)
* 32 pieces:

  * 1 white king, 1 white queen, 2 white rooks, 2 white bishops, 2 white knights, 8 white pawns
  * 1 black king, 1 black queen, 2 black rooks, 2 black bishops, 2 black knights, 8 black pawns
* Rule leaflet (or FIDE Laws of Chess)
* Optional: chess clock, algebraic‑notation score sheets, piece storage box

## Setup

1. Orient the board so a light square is on each player’s right‑hand corner (“light on right”).
2. Arrange pieces on the two nearest ranks:

   * Back rank (a1–h1 / a8–h8): rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, bishop, knight, rook (queen starts on her matching color).
   * Front rank: pawns on the second rank.
3. White moves first.

## How to Play

A turn consists of moving one own piece according to its legal moves:

* King 1 square any direction (plus castling once per side)
* Queen any number of squares orthogonally or diagonally
* Rook any number of squares orthogonally
* Bishop any number of squares diagonally
* Knight L‑shape (two plus one) and may jump over pieces
* Pawn 1 square forward (optionally 2 from its initial square), captures one step diagonally, promotes on the eighth rank, and may capture *en passant*

A move that attacks the enemy king is check; the opponent must remove the threat. If no legal move avoids capture, the king is checkmated and the game ends. Games can also end in various types of draw (stalemate, threefold repetition, 50‑move rule, insufficient material, agreement). Competitive play typically uses a chess clock to enforce time controls.
