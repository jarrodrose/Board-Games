## Overview  
Risk is the quintessential game of global conquest, first published in 1957 (as La Conquête du Monde) and refined by Parker Brothers/Hasbro into the version most players know today. On an abstracted world map divided into 42 territories and 6 continents, 2 – 6 commanders build armies, forge alliances, and wage dice‑driven battles to eliminate opponents and control every territory. Classic Risk marries straightforward area‑control mechanics with tense diplomacy: treaties, betrayals, and surprise offensives are every bit as important as lucky rolls. Its simple ruleset, high player interaction, and dramatic swings of fortune have made it a mainstay of family game nights and strategy enthusiasts alike for decades.

## Components (What's in the Box)  
- Tri‑fold world game board (42 territories across 6 continents)  
- 56 Risk cards (42 territory cards + 2 Jokers + 12 Secret Mission cards in modern editions)  
- 5 or 6 complete armies (color sets of Infantry, Cavalry = 5 Infantry, Artillery = 10 Infantry)  
- 5 dice (3 red attacker dice, 2 white defender dice)  
- Cardboard or plastic war crates/trays for component storage (varies by edition)  
- Rulebook

(Many modern copies also include redesigned figures, mission mode, and hinged storage crates.)

## Setup  
1. Choose a color and take all matching army pieces. Place one Infantry on the 0 space of the score track if your edition has one (optional for classic Risk).  
2. Determine initial territories: either deal all 42 territory cards evenly, then place one Infantry on each owned territory, or use the faster “free placement” or “draft” methods described in the rulebook.  
3. Claim extra starting armies (based on player count) and deploy them, one army at a time, onto any territory you already control.  
4. Shuffle the Risk cards to form a draw deck; set dice and spare armies nearby. Choose a starting player at random.  

## How to Play  
On your turn perform, in order:  

1. Reinforcement Phase  
   - Receive new armies: ⌊(controlled territories ÷ 3)⌋ (min 3) + continent bonuses + traded‑in Risk card sets (if any).  
2. Attack Phase (optional)  
   - Declare attacks from a territory you own to an adjacent enemy territory. Roll up to 3 red dice (attackers) vs. up to 2 white dice (defenders); compare highest pairs to resolve casualties. Continue attacking as desired.  
   - When you conquer at least one territory, draw one Risk card at turn’s end (if eligible).  
3. Fortify Phase  
   - Move any number of armies from one owned territory to an adjacent owned territory (or along a connected path, depending on house rules/edition).  

Winning the Game  
- World Domination: eliminate every opponent and control all 42 territories.  
- Secret Mission (optional mode): complete your dealt mission card before anyone else.
