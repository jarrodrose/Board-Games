([File:Carcassonne with several expansions.jpg - Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Carcassonne_with_several_expansions.jpg)) *A game of **Carcassonne** in progress, featuring a medieval landscape built with tiles and meeples.*

## Overview  
**Carcassonne** is a classic tile-placement strategy board game set in medieval France. It was designed by Klaus-Jürgen Wrede and first published in 2000 ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=Carcassonne%20,Spiele%20Preis%20awards%20in%202001)). The game is named after the walled city of Carcassonne in southern France, reflecting its medieval fortress theme ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=It%20is%20named%20after%20the,the%20box%2C%20was%20released%20in)). In Carcassonne, players draw and place landscape tiles to build out a map of cities, roads, monasteries, and fields, claiming these features with their wooden follower tokens (meeples) to score points. The gameplay is **simple to learn** yet offers **strategic depth** – making it appealing to both families and serious gamers. Carcassonne won the prestigious **Spiel des Jahres** (Game of the Year) award in 2001 and has since spawned numerous expansions and spin-offs ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=Games%20%20,Spiele%20Preis%20awards%20in%202001)). Its blend of light tactical decision-making and historical theme (developing medieval cities and infrastructure) gives it a broad, enduring appeal.

## Components (What's in the Box)  
The base *Carcassonne* game comes with a set of quality components that allow you to create the landscape and keep score:  

- **72** land tiles (terrain squares depicting roads, cities, monasteries, and fields) ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=The%20original%20board%20game%20has,expansions)) – including one starting tile.  
- **40** wooden follower tokens (meeples) in 5 colors ([Carcassonne - Z-MAN Games](https://www.zmangames.com/game/carcassonne/#:~:text=,1%20Scoreboard)) – 8 per player color (used for claiming features and one for scoring).  
- **12** river tiles ([Carcassonne - Z-MAN Games](https://www.zmangames.com/game/carcassonne/#:~:text=,1%20Scoreboard)) – an optional mini-expansion (The River) included in current editions, used as an alternative start.  
- **5** abbot meeples ([Carcassonne - Z-MAN Games](https://www.zmangames.com/game/carcassonne/#:~:text=,1%20Scoreboard)) – a mini-expansion piece (one per player color) that can be used to claim monasteries or gardens in newer rules.  
- **1** scoring track **board** (scoreboard) to keep score during the game ([Carcassonne - Z-MAN Games](https://www.zmangames.com/game/carcassonne/#:~:text=,1%20Scoreboard)).  
- **Rulebook** with the game rules and instructions ([Carcassonne - Z-MAN Games](https://www.zmangames.com/game/carcassonne/#:~:text=What%E2%80%99s%20in%20the%20box)).  

*(Note: Newer editions include the **River** and **Abbot** mini-expansions in the base box, hence the extra river tiles and abbot pieces ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=The%20original%20board%20game%20has,expansions)).)*

## Setup  
Setting up *Carcassonne* is quick and easy:  

1. **Prepare the Tiles:** Take the single **starting tile** (in current editions, this may be a dark-backed tile or the start of the River) and place it face-up in the middle of the table as the seed of the map. Shuffle all remaining land tiles **face-down** into stacks or a draw pile within reach ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=The%20game%20board%20is%20a,consists%20of%20three%20distinct%20phases)). *(If using the River tiles, set those aside to use at the beginning as per the rulebook.)*  
2. **Scoreboard:** Place the **scoreboard** (score track) near the play area.  
3. **Distribute Meeples:** Each player chooses a color and takes their set of meeple pieces. Give each player **7** meeples as their personal supply, and **place the 8th meeple of each color on the 0 space of the scoreboard** to track scores ([](https://images.zmangames.com/filer_public/d5/20/d5208d61-8583-478b-a06d-b49fc9cd7aaa/zm7810_carcassonne_rules.pdf#:~:text=green%2C%20blue%2C%20and%20black,your%20first%20game%2C%20the%20abbots)). (Any unused meeples or the extra abbot pieces can be left in the box if not needed for the base game.)  
4. **Starting Player:** Randomly choose a starting player (e.g. the youngest player goes first ([](https://images.zmangames.com/filer_public/d5/20/d5208d61-8583-478b-a06d-b49fc9cd7aaa/zm7810_carcassonne_rules.pdf#:~:text=constitute%20each%20player%E2%80%99s%20personal%20supply,for%20example%2C%20the%20youngest))). Now you’re ready to begin playing!  

## How to Play  
**Carcassonne** is played in turns, clockwise around the table. On each turn, a player does the following actions:

1. **Draw and Place a Tile:** The player draws one random land tile from the face-down supply and adds it to the map. The new tile **must be placed adjacent** to at least one existing tile, with all touching edges **matching** the existing terrain features (roads must connect to roads, fields to fields, cities to cities, etc.) ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=To%20start%20each%20turn%2C%20a,7%20%5D%3A%208%E2%80%939)). (If a drawn tile has no legal placement, which is rare, it may be removed from play or set aside ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=adjacent%20edges%20only%3B%20corners%20do,7%20%5D%3A%208%E2%80%939)).)  
2. **Deploy a Meeple (optional):** After placing the tile, the player may choose to **place one of their meeples** from their supply onto a feature on that just-placed tile – either a road, a city segment, a monastery, or a field. This can only be done if **no other meeple is currently occupying that continuous feature** (for example, you can’t place a meeple on a road if that road connects to another tile where a meeple is already present) ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=After%20placing%20each%20newly%20drawn,city)). The meeple is placed standing up on roads, cities, or monasteries (claiming it as a highwayman, knight, or monk respectively), or laid down in a field (claiming it as a farmer).  
3. **Score Completed Features:** After tile placement (and possible meeple placement), check if any feature was **completed** by that tile placement. A feature is completed when it is fully enclosed (cities completely walled off, roads with both ends finished, monasteries surrounded by 8 tiles). If a feature is completed, it is **scored immediately**. The player who has a meeple on that feature scores points according to the rules (for example, completed roads are typically worth 1 point per tile; completed cities are 2 points per tile (+2 per pennant shield); a completed monastery is 9 points – 1 for the monastery tile + 1 per each of the 8 surrounding tiles) ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=If%20any%20feature%20,6)). After scoring, any meeples on that completed feature are returned to their owners’ supply, ready to be used again in future turns ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=If%20any%20feature%20,6)). (Fields are an exception – farmers remain until game end and score later.)  
4. **End of Turn:** The turn ends after scoring. Play then passes to the next player, who draws a new tile and repeats the process.

**Game End:** The game continues until **all tiles have been placed** and the draw pile is empty. After the last tile is placed, a final scoring happens: all **incomplete features** on the board are now scored (cities, roads, and monasteries score fewer points if unfinished, and **fields** are scored now for the first time, typically 3 points per completed city connected to each farmer) ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=The%20game%20ends%20when%20the,6)). Players add these final points to their scores. Finally, the player with the **highest score** wins the game! ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=The%20game%20ends%20when%20the,6)) In case of a tie, the tied players share the victory.  

Throughout the game, each player has a limited pool of meeples to use (usually 7 available on the board, since one is on the score track) ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=to%20the%20player%27s%20stock,6)). Managing your followers – when to commit a meeple to claim a feature and when to hold back – is a key strategic element. There is an element of luck in the tile draw, but good placement decisions and tactical use of meeples will greatly influence your success.

## Why You Might Enjoy It  
- **Accessible Gameplay:** *Carcassonne* is very easy to learn and teach. The rules are straightforward, so new players (even kids or non-gamers) can start playing within minutes. It’s often cited as an excellent “gateway game” – an introduction to the hobby of modern board games ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=Carcassonne%20is%20considered%20to%20be,14)).  
- **Strategic Depth:** Despite its simple rules, there is plenty of strategy and meaningful decision-making. Players must decide where to place tiles for maximum benefit and whether to deploy a meeple or save it for a future opportunity. Competing for control of lucrative cities or fields adds a fun strategic layer without being overly aggressive.  
- **High Replayability:** The game offers a new experience each time because the map builds differently every game. The random tile draw and countless ways tiles can connect ensure that no two games are the same. This unpredictability keeps the gameplay fresh and encourages creative tactics.  
- **Engaging Theme:** Building a medieval landscape together is satisfying and visually appealing. As the table fills with tiles, you create a unique map with cities, roads, and farms. The theme is light but charming – you get the feel of developing the countryside around a medieval fortified city.  
- **Quick & Fun:** *Carcassonne* plays in about half an hour, and downtime is minimal since each turn is pretty quick. It scales well from 2 up to 5 players. The game moves at a brisk pace, making it great for a weeknight or family game session. It’s the kind of game where you often finish and immediately consider playing again, trying new approaches.

## Stats  
- **Number of Players:** 2–5 players (base game). *Best with 2–4. (With expansions, it can accommodate 6 or more players.)* ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=))  
- **Age Range:** 7 and up ([Carcassonne - Z-MAN Games](https://www.zmangames.com/game/carcassonne/#:~:text=2%20)) (suitable for kids, families, and adults alike).  
- **Approx. Duration:** 30–45 minutes per game ([Carcassonne - Z-MAN Games](https://www.zmangames.com/game/carcassonne/#:~:text=2%20)).  
- **Complexity / Learning Curve:** Low. *Carcassonne* is easy to learn with its clear rules and turns, making it a beginner-friendly **light strategy** game ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=Carcassonne%20is%20considered%20to%20be,14)). (Game complexity on BoardGameGeek is around 1.9/5, meaning it’s quite accessible.) 

## Expansions  
*Carcassonne* has a large number of expansions that can enhance or change the gameplay. These official expansions introduce new tiles, rules, and meeple types, and they are generally designed to mix-and-match with the base game. Playing with multiple expansions can increase the complexity and length of the game (in fact, using many expansions at once can more than **double** the playtime) ([Carcassonne (board game) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcassonne_(board_game)#:~:text=Several%20official%20expansions%20for%20Carcassonne,and%20may%20be%20played%20together)).
