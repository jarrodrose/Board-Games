## Overview
Catan (previously called The Settlers of Catan) is a landmark strategy board game where players take on the roles of settlers striving to develop and expand their colonies on the island of Catan. Each turn, dice rolls determine which resources (lumber, wool, grain, brick, and ore) the island produces. Players then trade or use these resources to build roads, settlements, and cities in a race to earn victory points. With its blend of resource management, negotiation, and territory expansion, Catan has become one of the most widely recognized gateway games, introducing countless people to modern board gaming.

## Components (What's in the Box)
- Hexagonal terrain tiles representing different resource types
- Number tokens (2–12) placed on terrain hexes
- Resource cards (lumber, wool, grain, brick, ore)

- Robber token
- Dice
- Rulebook

(*Exact components may vary based on the edition you own.*)

## Setup
1. Arrange the hexagonal terrain tiles to form the island. A setup guide is typically included in the rulebook, or you can arrange tiles randomly.
2. Place number tokens on each resource hex.
3. Put the robber on the desert tile (if included).
4. Each player chooses a color and takes five settlements, four cities, and fifteen roads.
5. Each player places two settlements and two roads on the board (in the standard version).
6. Shuffle and place the development cards face down, then distribute resource cards as needed to begin the game.

## How to Play
1. **Resource Production**: Each turn begins with a dice roll. The number rolled indicates which tiles produce resources. Any player with a settlement or city adjacent to those tiles collects the matching resource cards.
2. **Trade and Build**: After collecting resources, you may trade with other players or use resource cards to build roads, settlements, cities, or purchase development cards.
3. **Robber and Seven**: If a 7 is rolled, the robber is moved to a resource hex, blocking its production. The player who moved the robber also steals one card from a player with a settlement or city adjacent to the robber's new location.
4. **Victory Points**: You earn victory points for each settlement (1 point), city (2 points), and special achievements (e.g., Longest Road, Largest Army). The first player to reach 10 points wins.
