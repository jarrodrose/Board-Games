## Overview  
Tsuro: The Game of the Path is a fast, elegant tile‑laying game first published in 2004. Players lay curved “path” tiles on a 6 × 6 grid, guiding their stone markers along the ever‑growing network of lines while trying to stay on the board and avoid colliding with other players. The last stone remaining wins. Simple rules (place a tile, move your stone, draw a new tile) combine with tense spatial planning, creating a family‑friendly experience that rewards foresight and a touch of risk‑taking.

## Components (What’s in the Box)  
- 1 folding game board (6 × 6 grid)  
- 35 path tiles  
- 8 stone tokens (player markers)  
- 1 Dragon tile (used when the tile draw pile empties)  
- Rulebook  

## Setup  
1. Unfold the board and give each player a stone; unused stones return to the box.  
2. Shuffle the 35 path tiles face‑down. Deal 3 tiles to each player, keeping hands hidden.  
3. Players place their stones on any unoccupied start mark around the board edge (one per edge space).  
4. Choose a starting player by any method; turns proceed clockwise.

## How to Play  
1. Place a Tile – On your turn, choose one tile from your hand and place it adjacent to your stone so its paths continue outward.  
2. Move Stones – All stones whose paths are extended (yours first, then any others reached) travel along their connected lines until they stop at the board edge or another tile edge.  
3. Check for Elimination – Any stone that runs off the board or collides with another stone is removed from play.  
4. Draw a Tile – Draw one tile to refill your hand to three (unless the supply is empty; then the Dragon tile rules apply).  
5. Winning – Be the last player with a stone on the board.
