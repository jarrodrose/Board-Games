overview: 'Disney Villainous lets 2–6 players step into the shoes of iconic Disney villains, each pursuing a unique, movie-inspired objective while thwarting opponents with “Fate” cards drawn from their own films. Every villain has a personal board (Realm), custom villain deck, and matching Fate deck. On your turn you move your villain mover to a location, perform the available actions, and play cards that advance your scheme or hinder your rivals. The asymmetry—every villain wins in a different way—makes each play feel fresh, and expansions add new baddies who seamlessly mix with the originals.'

## Setup

1. Each player chooses a villain, takes its mover, board, villain & Fate decks, reference card, and guide.
2. Place your board in front of you and your mover on the leftmost location. Lock any location showing a lock icon.
3. Shuffle your villain deck; draw 4 cards. Shuffle your Fate deck and place it face-down.
4. Put the Power tokens in the cauldron. Give 1 Power to the second player, 2 Power to the third and fourth players, etc.
5. Select a first player and begin.

## How to Play

**On your turn:**

1. **Move** your villain to a different location.
2. **Perform actions** shown at that location in any order (play cards, gain Power, Fate an opponent, move items/allies, activate abilities, or vanquish heroes).
3. **Refill** your hand to 4 cards. Then the next player takes a turn.

**Fate:** When you take a Fate action, draw the top two cards of an opponent’s Fate deck, choose one to resolve (often adding a hero or effect to their Realm), and discard the other.

**Winning:** Fulfil your villain’s printed objective before any rival does—e.g., have 20 Power (*Prince John*), start your turn with *Aladdin* defeated (*Jafar*), or get *Peter Pan* to the Jolly Roger with no heroes present (*Captain Hook*).

## Why You Might Enjoy It

* Rich **asymmetric strategies**—every villain is essentially a new puzzle.
* High **interaction** through the Fate mechanic keeps all players engaged.
* **Modular expansions** let you combine any villains for new match-ups up to six players.
