overview: 'Monopoly Deal is a fast, portable card‑game take on the classic Monopoly board game. Players race to collect three complete property sets while tactically managing money cards, charging rent, and springing action cards that steal or swap properties. With hands limited to seven cards, every turn is a puzzle of resource management and timing. Games finish in about 15 minutes, delivering the property‑trading flavor of Monopoly without the multi‑hour commitment.'

## Setup

1. Shuffle the full deck and deal 5 cards to each player.
2. Place the remaining deck face‑down as a draw pile; leave space for a face‑up discard pile.
3. Choose a starting player by any method.

## How to Play

On your turn:

1. Draw 2 cards from the deck (unless you have zero cards, in which case draw 5).
2. Play up to 3 cards to your tableau or discard pile in any combination:

   * Bank a money or Action card (face‑up money stack).
   * Lay a property into your property area.
   * Play an Action (charge Rent, steal/swaps, force deals, etc.). Action cards then go to the discard unless banked as money.
3. Check hand limit: Discard down to 7 cards.
4. Play passes left.

Payments: When charged rent or fees, pay from bank first, then properties if needed (no change given).

Winning: Be the first to assemble three full property sets in front of you.

## Why You Might Enjoy It

* Compact deck—perfect travel or filler game.
* High interaction: clever timing of Deal Breaker, Sly Deal, and Just Say No! creates memorable table drama.
* Simple rules yet meaningful hand‑management decisions each turn.
