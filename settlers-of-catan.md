# Settlers of Catan

## Summary

Settlers of Catan is a renowned multiplayer board game designed by Klaus Teuber and first published in 1995. In this game, players assume the roles of settlers on the fictional island of Catan, striving to establish and expand their communities. The island's layout is modular, consisting of hexagonal tiles representing different terrains, ensuring a unique setup for each playthrough.

Players collect resources such as wood, brick, wheat, sheep, and ore based on the placement of their settlements adjacent to these terrains. These resources are then utilized to build roads, additional settlements, and cities, or to purchase development cards that offer various advantages. A distinctive feature of the game is the trading system, where players negotiate and exchange resources, adding a dynamic layer of strategy and interaction.

The objective is to be the first to accumulate a set number of victory points, typically achieved through the expansion of settlements and cities, as well as earning special cards for the longest road or largest army. Settlers of Catan has garnered critical acclaim for its strategic depth and replayability, earning prestigious awards such as the Spiel des Jahres in 1995.
